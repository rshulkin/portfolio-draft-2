        <p>A great place to start is a

            It'll get you running a fantastic distance! It's important not to focus on your pace, especially in the beginning 
            of your running. Instead, focus on getting your run done, while slowly increasing your duration. You will build endurance
            with patience, and with that your pace will decrease.

        <p>Consistent, variable training can be done anywhere- anytime. Treadmills can be highly beneficial, even in the 
			summer season. They really help stabilize pace and help keep you running slow in the start. Running training should 
			be different, and exciting! Good news is, you can change up your environment by going inside or outside, on a track 
			or treadmill, with a group or alone. And within your workouts, it's a good idea to plan your runs in a way that you 
			can fit in speed runs, tempo runs, and a long run each week. This is a good place to start. Like any other workout plan,
			running requires different focuses on different days- this is what will keep your days exciting and different!
